# YouTube OnRepeat
Chrome Extension enabling users to play YouTube videos on repeat (inspired by the OnRepeat feature on Spotify), either for a defined time period or indefinitely. Built in JavaScript. 

<!-- 
## Motivation
I use YouTube to listen to a lot of music (that can't be found in other locations – e.g. fan-edited music, mashups, covers, etc.) while working, studying, etc. – and like to listen to my music on repeat; while some popular songs do have "1-hour versions", where people have looped the songs over and over again for a defined amount of time, this is not available for most videos. This extension solves this problem.  -->
